# CSC160_L4_Create <br>
Welcome to your next assignment! Your assignment this week is to creat a short quiz! Please see requirements below: <br>
-Your assignment should be completed in VS Code on your machine, not in GitHub. <br>
-You will only be using GitHub to get the URL for your repository. That is the URL in the address bar right now! <br>

The first thing that you should do is reference the [Submitting an Assignment using Github](https://otc.instructure.com/courses/50195/files/8233081?wrap=1) document. This will walk you through the process of ensuring that Git is installed on your computer and that you can download your assignment. Once you have completed step 3 in the instruction, you will be ready to begin programming. Please use the below instructions as a point of reference. <br>

To begin the assignment, open the Create4.py file in VS Code. <br>
For an example output, open the ExampleOutput.txt file. <br>

## Program Description <br>
This week you will be creating a quiz program that asks the user a minimum of three multiple choice questions. Each question should have 4 available answers with only 1 corrrect answer. Once the user completes the quiz, the program should show which questions that they got right/wrong as well as the chosen/correct answer. Finally, before terminating, the program should produce a score for the user. This score should be a percentage. <br>

## Program Requirements <br>
-First and foremost, the subject matter of the quiz must be something that is significant to you. It can be about a particular franchise, book, movie, game, etc... your choice! <br>
-You must store the answers to each question in some kind of collection (like a list). <br>
-You may not use loops in this assignment. <br> 
-You should use branching/conditional statements to evaluate if an answer is correct <br>
-Be sure to follow the flow of the program outlined in the Program Description <br>
-As always, leave detailed comments in your code. <br>
-Do not have the user type in an answer as a string. (If the answer is 'Dog' they should not type 'Dog', they should be able to enter a,b,c,d or 1,2,3,4 to select their input instead of typing it themselves).
